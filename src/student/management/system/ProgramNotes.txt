--------NOTES ON WHAT I LEARNT--------

This is a basic Student Management System program that simulates a School with teachers and students.

---Student class:---
* For the student class we create instance variables for an id, name, grade, feesPaid
and feeTotal.

* The constructor parameter accepts and initializes the id, name and grade.
* feesPaid is set = 0 and feeTotal is set to 5000 for every student that is created.

Student class Methods:
* Since feesPaid is set to 0, a payFees method is needed so students can

---Teacher class:---
* The teacher class creates a teacher object and has instance variables for id, name, salary
and salaryEarned.

The constructor takes in parameters for id, name and salary... salaryEarned is set to 0

---School class---
* The most important class where I learnt quite a bit.
* The School class holds many teachers and students using ArrayLists.
* An important note that I learnt is that setting instance variables and methods as static...
  allows you to use them outside of the class and this is important since we need to use the
  methods from the School class inside the Teacher and Student class.

* The School class has instance variables of Teacher and Students
* It also has totalMoneyEarned and totalMoneySpent which means that we need to access those
  variables in the Teacher and Student class, hence where declaring them as "static" comes in
